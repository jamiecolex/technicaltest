## App Features

*	10,000 unique combinations
*	Nicknames are consistent, the same first and last name combination always generates the same nickname.
*	Hashing is used so family members, similar names, same initials etc. will still generate a unique nickname.
*	Upper/lower case does not cause different names, for example "joanna" and "Joanna" will always give the same nickname.
*	Shortened first names still give the same nickname, for example "Jo" and "Joanna".
*	Nicknames are always coherent by using word lists that work well together (adjectives and animals).
